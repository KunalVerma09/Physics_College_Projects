# Second Year B.Sc. Physics Projects

This repository contains my Second Year B.Sc. physics python projects for the first and second semester of the academic year.

## First semester project
Double intergral calculator and evaluator. Compares 3 methods of calculating the double integral of the user input function (of a predefined form) and the user input limits. The methods used are Midpoint method, Trapezoidal method, and Simpsons 1/3rd rule. It then provides the error in the answers w.r.t. the user provided true value and returns the method which gave the best answer.

## Second semester project
Quantum mechanics simulation of a particle in a 2D box. Plots the possible 3D probability distributions of a particles position in a 2D quantum well given its quantum state.
